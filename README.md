In the Smart Cities scenario, the municipalities benefit from the data collected from multiple sources, such as official documentation, third parties information, and environmental sensors. To avoid the conflicting records between official and non-official sources, it is necessary to detect the inconsistencies regarding the geospatial data provided by them. To this end, the map matching task, i.e., the task of identifying correspondent features between two geospatial data sources, can be applied. In this context, the map matching becomes a powerful task to assist several projects interested in extract information from geospatial data (for instance, control of deforestation, fires and floods) and approaches related to smart cities. Regarding spatial Big Data, the map matching task is confronted with challenges related to volume and veracity of the data. In this sense, we propose a Spark-based map matching approach, denoted MATCH-UPS. To evaluate the MATCH-UPS approach, real-world data sources of New York (USA) and Curitiba (Brazil) were applied. Based on the experimental results, we can highlight that the proposed approach improved the precision (concerning effectiveness) by 26\% and reduced the execution time by one third.
